# Monitoring and Alerting Strategy

## Overview

Queue-Keeper's monitoring strategy ensures proactive detection of performance degradation, service failures, and SLA violations. The comprehensive approach combines application metrics, infrastructure monitoring, and business KPIs to provide complete operational visibility.

## SLA Monitoring

### Performance SLA Tracking

**Primary SLA Metrics**:

| Metric | SLA Target | Measurement Window | Alert Threshold | Business Impact |
|--------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Webhook Response Time** | <1 second (95th percentile) | 5-minute rolling window | >800ms | GitHub webhook timeout risk |
| **Webhook Success Rate** | >99.9% | 15-minute rolling window | <99.5% | Failed webhook processing |
| **Queue Processing Rate** | <5 minute end-to-end latency | 10-minute rolling window | >3 minutes | Bot processing delays |
| **System Availability** | >99.9% uptime | 24-hour rolling window | <99.0% | Service outage impact |

### SLA Violation Response

**Response Time Escalation**:

1. **Warning (800ms-900ms)**: Platform team notification, performance investigation
2. **Critical (900ms-1000ms)**: Immediate scale-out trigger, on-call notification
3. **Emergency (>1000ms)**: Auto-scaling activation, incident commander engagement

**Availability Escalation**:

1. **Degraded (<99.9%)**: Health check investigation, potential failover preparation
2. **Outage (<99.0%)**: Immediate incident response, customer communication
3. **Extended Outage (>15 min)**: Disaster recovery procedures, executive notification

### Alert Routing and Escalation

**Primary Routing**:

```mermaid
graph TB
    ALERT[Alert Triggered] --> EVAL{Severity Level}

    EVAL -->|Critical| ON_CALL[On-Call Engineer]
    EVAL -->|High| PLATFORM[Platform Team + On-Call]
    EVAL -->|Medium| PLATFORM_ONLY[Platform Team]
    EVAL -->|Low| BUSINESS_HOURS[Business Hours Queue]

    ON_CALL --> INCIDENT[Incident Response]
