# Functional Requirements

## Core Capabilities

### Webhook Processing Pipeline

**REQ-001: GitHub Webhook Intake**

- Queue-Keeper MUST accept HTTP POST requests from GitHub webhook endpoints
- Queue-Keeper MUST validate webhook signatures using HMAC-SHA256 with GitHub webhook secrets
- Queue-Keeper MUST respond to GitHub within 1 second (target) and 10 seconds (maximum)
- Queue-Keeper MUST support all GitHub webhook event types (issues, pull_request, push, release, etc.)

**REQ-002: Raw Payload Persistence**

- Queue-Keeper MUST persist all incoming webhook payloads to Azure Blob Storage immediately upon receipt
- Blob storage MUST include metadata: timestamp, event ID, repository, event type, signature validation status
- Raw payloads MUST be stored with immutable naming convention: `{year}/{month}/{day}/{event_id}.json`
- Storage MUST support replay scenarios for debugging and reprocessing

**REQ-003: Event Normalization**

- Queue-Keeper MUST transform GitHub webhook payloads into a standardized event schema
- Normalized events MUST include: event_id, repository, entity_type, entity_id, session_id, original_payload
- Event IDs MUST be unique, deterministic, and sortable (e.g., ULID or timestamp-based UUID)
- Session IDs MUST follow pattern: `{repo_owner}/{repo_name}/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`

**REQ-004: Queue Routing & Distribution**

- Queue-Keeper MUST route normalized events to configured bot-specific Service Bus queues
- Routing configuration MUST be statically defined in application configuration
- Queue-Keeper MUST support one-to-many routing (single event to multiple bot queues)
- Queue-Keeper MUST use Service Bus sessions to guarantee per-entity ordering

### Bot Integration

**REQ-005: Event Ordering Guarantees**

- Events for the same entity (PR/issue) MUST be processed in chronological order
- Events for different entities MAY be processed in parallel
- Session-based queuing MUST prevent concurrent processing of the same entity across bot instances

**REQ-006: Bot Queue Management**

- Each bot MUST have a dedicated Service Bus queue with session support enabled
- Queue names MUST follow convention: `queue-keeper-{bot-name}` (e.g., `queue-keeper-task-tactician`)
- Bot queues MUST be created and managed via Terraform (external to this repository)
- Queue-Keeper MUST NOT create or delete queues dynamically

### Reliability & Error Handling

**REQ-007: Retry Mechanisms**

- Queue-Keeper MUST implement exponential backoff retry for transient failures
- Maximum retry attempts: 3 for blob storage operations, 5 for Service Bus operations
- Failed events after max retries MUST be routed to a dead letter queue
- Dead letter queue MUST preserve original event metadata and failure details

**REQ-008: Replay Capabilities**

- Queue-Keeper MUST support reprocessing events from blob storage
- Replay MUST be triggered via administrative interface or API endpoint
- Replay MUST respect original event ordering and session constraints
- Replay MUST be idempotent (duplicate detection via event IDs)

**REQ-009: Circuit Breaker Pattern**

- Queue-Keeper MUST implement circuit breakers for external service dependencies
- Circuit breaker MUST trip after 5 consecutive failures to any downstream service
- Half-open state MUST allow limited testing after 30-second cooldown period
- Circuit breaker status MUST be exposed via health check endpoints

### Configuration Management

**REQ-010: Bot Subscription Configuration**

- Bot event subscriptions MUST be defined in static configuration files
- Configuration MUST specify: bot_name, queue_name, subscribed_event_types, ordering_required
- Configuration changes MUST require application restart (no hot-reloading)
- Configuration MUST be validated at startup with clear error messages for misconfigurations

Example configuration structure:

```yaml
bots:
  - name: "task-tactician"
    queue: "queue-keeper-task-tactician"
    events: ["issues.opened", "issues.closed", "issues.labeled"]
    ordered: true
  - name: "merge-warden"
    queue: "queue-keeper-merge-warden"
    events: ["pull_request.opened", "pull_request.synchronize", "pull_request.closed"]
    ordered: true
  - name: "spec-sentinel"
    queue: "queue-keeper-spec-sentinel"
    events: ["push", "pull_request.opened"]
    ordered: false
```

### Security Requirements

**REQ-011: Authentication & Authorization**

- Queue-Keeper MUST validate GitHub webhook signatures for all incoming requests
- Invalid signatures MUST result in HTTP 401 Unauthorized response
- Queue-Keeper MUST retrieve GitHub webhook secrets from Azure Key Vault
- Service-to-service authentication MUST use Azure Managed Identity

**REQ-012: Secret Management**

- GitHub webhook secrets MUST be stored in Azure Key Vault
- Key Vault access MUST use Azure Managed Identity (no connection strings or keys)
- Secrets MUST be cached for maximum 5 minutes to balance security and performance
- Secret rotation MUST be supported without application restart

### Observability Requirements

**REQ-013: Logging & Telemetry**

- Queue-Keeper MUST log all webhook processing activities with structured logging (JSON)
- Log levels: ERROR (failures), WARN (retries), INFO (successful processing), DEBUG (detailed tracing)
- Logs MUST include correlation IDs to trace events across the processing pipeline
- Telemetry MUST be sent to Azure Application Insights

**REQ-014: Metrics & Monitoring**

- Queue-Keeper MUST expose metrics for: request count, response time, error rate, queue depth
- Custom metrics MUST track: events processed per bot, signature validation failures, replay operations
- Health check endpoint MUST return overall system status and dependency health
- Metrics MUST integrate with Azure Monitor and support custom alerting rules

**REQ-015: Audit Trail**

- All webhook processing activities MUST be auditable
- Audit logs MUST include: timestamp, event_id, repository, processing_outcome, retry_count
- Audit data MUST be retained for minimum 90 days
- Compliance reports MUST be generateable from audit data

## Event Flow Requirements

**REQ-016: End-to-End Processing Flow**

1. GitHub webhook received and signature validated
2. Raw payload persisted to blob storage
3. Event normalized to standard schema
4. Event routed to configured bot queues with session ID
5. Processing completion logged with audit trail
6. Response sent to GitHub within SLA

**REQ-017: Failure Recovery Flow**

1. Transient failures trigger exponential backoff retry
2. Persistent failures route event to dead letter queue
3. Critical failures trigger circuit breaker protection
4. Failed events remain available for manual replay
5. System health impacts are minimized via graceful degradation

## Non-Functional Requirements

**REQ-018: Performance**

- Process 95% of webhooks within 500ms (excluding network latency)
- Support minimum 1000 concurrent webhook requests
- Memory usage MUST NOT exceed 512MB under normal load
- CPU utilization MUST remain below 80% under normal load

**REQ-019: Scalability**

- Auto-scale based on queue depth and resource utilization
- Support horizontal scaling up to 10 function instances
- Handle webhook bursts up to 10x normal traffic for 5 minutes
- Graceful degradation under extreme load conditions

**REQ-020: Availability**

- Target 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime/year maximum)
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 5 minutes
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 0 (no data loss acceptable)
- Support blue-green deployment with zero downtime

## Compatibility Requirements

**REQ-021: Cloud Platform Support**

- Primary implementation: Azure (Functions, Service Bus, Blob Storage, Key Vault)
- Architecture MUST NOT preclude future AWS implementation
- Cloud-specific code MUST be abstracted behind trait interfaces
- Configuration MUST support cloud-specific service endpoints and credentials

**REQ-022: GitHub Integration**

- Compatible with all GitHub webhook event types as of September 2025
- Support GitHub's webhook signature validation (X-Hub-Signature-256 header)
- Handle GitHub webhook delivery retry behavior gracefully
