# Queue-Keeper Specification

## Overview

Queue-Keeper is a Rust-based webhook intake and routing service that serves as the central entrypoint for all GitHub webhooks. It validates, normalizes, persists, and routes webhook events to downstream automation bots with guaranteed ordering and reliability.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Webhook Validation** - Verify GitHub webhook signatures (HMAC-SHA256)
2. **Event Persistence** - Store raw payloads in Azure Blob Storage for audit/replay
3. **Event Normalization** - Transform GitHub webhooks into standardized event schema
4. **Routing & Distribution** - Send events to configured bot queues with proper ordering
5. **Reliability** - Implement retries, dead letter queues, and replay mechanisms
6. **Observability** - Comprehensive logging, metrics, and alerting

## Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: < 1 second to GitHub (within 10s timeout limit)
- **Throughput**: Handle webhook bursts from active repositories
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale based on queue depth and CPU/memory utilization

## Document Structure

This specification is organized into the following sections:

### Architecture

- [Architecture Overview](architecture/
README.md) - High-level system design and component interactions
- [Container Deployment](./architecture/container-deployment.md) - Always-on container architecture vs Function Apps
- [Session Management](./architecture/session-management.md) - Flexible ordering strategies per bot

### Requirements

- [Functional Requirements](./requirements/functional-requirements.md) - Core system capabilities
- [Platform Requirements](./requirements/platform-requirements.md) - Azure service dependencies
- [Performance Requirements](./requirements/performance-requirements.md) - SLA and scalability targets
- [Scalability Requirements](./requirements/scalability-requirements.md) - Burst handling and auto-scaling

### Design

- [Event Schema](./design/event-schema.md) - Normalized event structure and payload format
- [Configuration Management](./design/configuration.md) - Container-based config with flexible ordering control
- [Error Handling](./design/error-handling.md) - Retry policies and failure recovery

### Domain

- [Vocabulary](./vocabulary.md) - Domain concepts and terminology definitions
- [Responsibilities](./responsibilities.md) - Component responsibilities and collaboration patterns
- [Constraints](./constraints.md) - Implementation rules and architectural boundaries
- [Assertions](./assertions.md) - Behavioral specifications and testable requirements

### Security

- [Security Model](./security/README.md) - Authentication, authorization, and secret management
- [Rate Limiting](./security/rate-limiting.md) - DDoS protection and abuse prevention

### Operations

- [Deployment](./operations/deployment.md) - Container Apps infrastructure and CI/CD
- [Observability](./operations/observability.md) - Distributed tracing and correlation across bots
- [Monitoring](./operations/monitoring.md) - Alerting, dashboards, and performance tracking
- [Scalability Operations](./operations/scalability.md) - Auto-scaling and load management

### Testing

- [Testing Strategy](./testing/README.md) - Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- [Performance Testing](./testing/performance-testing.md) - Load testing and capacity planning
- [Chaos Engineering](./testing/chaos-engineering.md) - Resilience testing and failure injection

## Status

**Current Phase**: Initial Specification\
**Target Deployment**: Azure (Primary), AWS (Future Alternative) \
**Implementation Language**: Rust \
**Infrastructure**: Terraform (External Repository)

## System Integration

For detailed behavioral assertions and requirements, see [Assertions](./assertions.md).

For information on how the queue-runtime and github-bot-sdk libraries integrate with Queue-Keeper, see [Library Integration](./integration.md).

## Edge Cases

### GitHub Behavior Edge Cases

- **Webhook Retries**: GitHub may retry webhook delivery up to 5 times; system MUST handle duplicate deliveries gracefully using event ID deduplication.
- **Large Payloads**: Webhooks approaching 1MB size limit MUST be processed without memory issues or timeouts.
- **Malformed JSON**: Invalid JSON payloads MUST be rejected with HTTP 400 and logged for investigation.
- **Missing Headers**: Webhooks missing required headers (X-GitHub-Event, X-Hub-Signature-256) MUST be rejected with HTTP 400.

### Azure Service Edge Cases

- **Service Bus Throttling**: When Service Bus returns throttling errors (429), Queue-Keeper MUST implement exponential backoff and circuit breaker protection.
- **Key Vault Unavailability**: If Key Vault is temporarily unavailable, cached secrets MUST continue to work until cache expiry.
- **Blob Storage Consistency**: New blob writes MUST be immediately readable for replay scenarios (strong consistency required).
- **Function Cold Start**: Cold start latency MUST NOT exceed 3 seconds and MUST NOT cause webhook timeouts.

### Network and Connectivity Edge Cases

- **Network Partitions**: Partial network failures affecting only some Azure services MUST trigger appropriate circuit breakers without total system failure.
- **DNS Resolution Failures**: DNS issues MUST be handled with retries and fallback mechanisms where possible.
- **TLS Certificate Rotation**: Azure service certificate rotations MUST NOT disrupt Queue-Keeper operations.

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this specification
2. Implement core webhook validation and normalization logic
3. Set up Azure infrastructure via Terraform
4. Develop bot queue routing and session management
5. Implement comprehensive testing and monitoring
6. Deploy to staging environment for integration testing
