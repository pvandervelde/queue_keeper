# Queue-Runtime Behavioral Assertions

## Overview

This document defines testable behavioral assertions for the queue-runtime library. These assertions verify that all provider implementations (Azure Service Bus, AWS SQS) behave consistently and meet the functional requirements regardless of the underlying queue technology.

## Core Queue Operations

### Assertion 1: Message Send Success

**Given**: A valid queue client and a message to send
**When**: `send_message()` is called with the message
**Then**: Operation returns `Ok(MessageId)` with a valid message identifier
**And**: Message is available for receiving from the same queue

**Test Criteria**:

- Message ID is non-empty and unique
- Sent message can be retrieved via `receive_message()`
- Message content matches exactly what was sent

### Assertion 2: Message Send to Non-Existent Queue

**Given**: A queue client configured for a non-existent queue
**When**: `send_message()` is called
**Then**: Operation returns `Err(QueueError::QueueNotFound)`
**And**: No message is sent to any queue

**Test Criteria**:

- Error type is specifically `QueueNotFound`
- Error includes the queue name that was not found
- No side effects occur (no partial sends)

### Assertion 3: Message Receive Success

**Given**: A queue with at least one message available
**When**: `receive_message()` is called
**Then**: Operation returns `Ok(Some(ReceivedMessage))`
**And**: Message contains the original payload and valid receipt handle

**Test Criteria**:

- Message payload matches what was originally sent
- Receipt handle is valid for completion operations
- Message visibility timeout starts immediately

### Assertion 4: Message Receive from Empty Queue

**Given**: A queue with no available messages
**When**: `receive_message()` is called with a timeout
**Then**: Operation returns `Ok(None)` when timeout expires
**And**: No error occurs

**Test Criteria**:

- Returns exactly at timeout boundary (Â±100ms tolerance)
- No exception or error returned
- Operation is cancellable before timeout

### Assertion 5: Message Completion Success

**Given**: A message that has been received but not yet completed
**When**: `complete_message()` is called with valid receipt handle
**Then**: Operation returns `Ok(())`
**And**: Message is permanently removed from the queue

**Test Criteria**:

- Message cannot be received again after completion
- Receipt handle becomes invalid after completion
- No error occurs during completion

### Assertion 6: Message Completion with Invalid Receipt

**Given**: An invalid or expired receipt handle
**When**: `complete_message()` is called
**Then**: Operation returns `Err(QueueError::InvalidReceipt)`
**And**: No messages are affected

**Test Criteria**:

- Error type is specifically `InvalidReceipt`
- Error includes the invalid receipt handle for debugging
- Queue state remains unchanged

## Session-Based Operations

### Assertion 7: Session Message Ordering (Azure Service Bus)

**Given**: A session-enabled queue and multiple messages with the same session ID
**When**: Messages are sent in sequence A, B, C
**Then**: Messages are received in the same order: A, B, C
**And**: No other session's messages interleave during processing

**Test Criteria**:

- Strict FIFO ordering within session
- Session lock prevents concurrent processing
- Messages from different sessions can be processed concurrently

### Assertion 8: Session Compatibility (AWS SQS)

**Given**: An AWS SQS queue configured for sessions (via message groups)
**When**: Session operations are performed
**Then**: Operations succeed with emulated session behavior
**And**: Ordering is preserved within message groups

**Test Criteria**:

- Message group ID used as session identifier
- FIFO ordering maintained within same message group
- Graceful degradation when native sessions unavailable

### Assertion 9: Session Lock Acquisition

**Given**: A session-enabled queue with messages in a specific session
**When**: `accept_session()` is called
**Then**: Operation returns `Ok(SessionClient)` with exclusive lock
**And**: Concurrent session acceptance fails with lock error

**Test Criteria**:

- Only one client can hold session lock at a time
- Lock automatically renewed during active processing
- Lock released on session client drop

### Assertion 10: Session Lock Timeout

**Given**: A session client that becomes inactive
**When**: Session lock timeout period expires
**Then**: Session lock is automatically released
**And**: Another client can acquire the session lock

**Test Criteria**:

- Lock timeout occurs at expected interval
- Messages become available to other clients
- Original client receives lock lost error on next operation

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Assertion 11: Network Connectivity Failure

**Given**: A queue client when network connectivity is lost
**When**: Any queue operation is attempted
**Then**: Operation returns `Err(QueueError::ConnectionFailed)`
**And**: Client can recover when connectivity is restored

**Test Criteria**:

- Specific connection error is returned
- Client automatically retries on connection recovery
- No corruption of internal client state

### Assertion 12: Provider Service Throttling

**Given**: A queue client experiencing provider throttling (HTTP 429)
**When**: Operations are attempted during throttling
**Then**: Client implements exponential backoff automatically
**And**: Operations eventually succeed when throttling stops

**Test Criteria**:

- Exponential backoff with jitter applied
- Maximum retry attempts respected
- Success after throttling period ends

### Assertion 13: Message Visibility Timeout Expiry

**Given**: A message that has been received but not completed
**When**: Visibility timeout period expires
**Then**: Message becomes available for receiving again
**And**: Original receipt handle becomes invalid

**Test Criteria**:

- Message reappears in queue after exact timeout period
- New receipt handle issued on re-receipt
- Old receipt handle returns `InvalidReceipt` error

### Assertion 14: Dead Letter Queue Routing

**Given**: A message that has exceeded maximum delivery attempts
**When**: Message processing fails repeatedly
**Then**: Message is automatically moved to dead letter queue
**And**: Original queue no longer contains the message

**Test Criteria**:

- Message appears in dead letter queue with metadata
- Original failure context preserved
- Dead letter queue configured correctly

## Configuration and Provider Selection

### Assertion 15: Provider Runtime Selection
