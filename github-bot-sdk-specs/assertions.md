# GitHub Bot SDK Behavioral Assertions

## Overview

This document defines testable behavioral assertions for the GitHub Bot SDK. These assertions verify that authentication, API operations, and event processing work correctly and securely according to GitHub's requirements and best practices.

## Authentication Assertions

### Assertion 1: JWT Token Generation

**Given**: A valid GitHub App ID and private key
**When**: `generate_jwt_token()` is called

**And**: Token contains correct `iss` claim matching App ID

**Test Criteria**:

- JWT structure is valid (header.payload.signature)
- `iss` claim matches provided App ID
- `iat` claim is current timestamp (Â±5 seconds)
